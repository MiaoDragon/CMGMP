- [ ] generate finger plan
    - [x] Forward check quasistatic
    - [x] forward check quasidynamic
    - [ ] (later) forward check dynamic
    - [ ] add new nodes during forward check?
- [ ] after plan generated
- [ ] test some examples

# code structure

- [ ] reduce replicated functions

# method improvement 

- [ ] any way to improve finger planning ?

# enginneering

- [ ] parallel
